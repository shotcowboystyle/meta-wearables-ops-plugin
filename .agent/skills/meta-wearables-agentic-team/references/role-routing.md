# Meta Wearables role routing

Use the narrowest set of roles that can prove the requested behavior. The roles are complementary; they are not permission to invent unsupported APIs.

The exact upstream role-to-local-owner contract lives in
[team-manifest.yaml](team-manifest.yaml); validate it before delegating a
full-SDK or cross-platform request.

| Request signal | Primary role | Required handoff | Evidence that remains separate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| “Connect glasses,” “pair,” “register,” “DAT” | `meta-wearables-route-planner` then `meta-dat-ios-integration` | package/version, callback, permissions, session states | mock link vs real glasses registration |
| “Android,” “Kotlin,” “Gradle,” “Manifest,” Android DAT | `meta-dat-android-integration` | Maven artifacts, initialization, `DatResult`, `Flow`/`StateFlow`, permissions, R8, and target config | Android mock/build vs named physical glasses |
| “full SDK,” “all capabilities,” “regular SDK,” or iOS/Android parity | `meta-wearables-full-sdk-audit` | Four runtime DAT module/artifact lanes plus the iOS test-only MockDevice client, source-conflict ledger, capability/evidence-plan entries, owner routes, fallbacks, and evidence gates | source/plugin inventory vs selected target build and physical behavior |

## Handoff packet

Every role handoff should include:

- target repository and exact app target;
- user outcome and whether the feature is phone-first, glasses-first, or dual-surface;
- exact device/model language supplied by the user and the runtime identifier, if known;
- SDK name, package tag/commit, and official source URL;
- permissions, entitlements, privacy, and data-retention assumptions;
- lifecycle states and a fallback when the wearable is unavailable;
- processing location, network/storage boundary, retention, consent, and thermal/lifecycle fallback;
- companion/firmware/on-glasses DAT-app state, Developer Mode or release channel, compatibility, first failure, and recovery status;
- shared domain state owner, platform adapter boundary, capability owner, event epoch, cancellation, stale-event, and test seam;
- current evidence level and the next proof needed.

If a required field is unknown, label it `to-verify`; do not silently substitute a similar model or SDK.

## Machine-readable routing receipt

Run the [route receipt runner](../scripts/route_capability.py) after selecting a
capability and before writing a target handoff:

```sh
python3 ../scripts/route_capability.py \
  --capability camera-photo \
  --workspace-root <knowledge-base-workspace> \
  --json
```

Use `--full-sdk` for the composite request. The runner reads the team manifest,
source-pinned surface manifest, and capability/evidence plan, then emits the
exact selected capabilities, surfaces, local role IDs, upstream handoff IDs,
privacy/fallback contracts, `PRE-*` tasks, evidence levels, terminology
actions, source snapshot, non-claims, and next action. It is read-only and
does not resolve credentials or promote any evidence level.

## Static fixture-suite receipt

Run the [static fixture suite](../scripts/run_static_fixture_suite.py) after a
recipe or fixture change:

```sh
python3 ../scripts/run_static_fixture_suite.py <workspace-root> \
  --ios-dat-checkout <selected-dat-ios-checkout> \
  --live-source --json
```

The suite runs the dependency-free shared-domain tests, Web App Node tests and
strict metadata preflight, Android target preflight, surface/capability/team/
recipe validators, every target-intake handoff, and the composite full-SDK route receipt. The iOS option
type-checks the four portable DAT starters against the selected simulator
XCFrameworks. `unavailable` and `not-run` are preserved in the receipt; none of
these results closes connected, physical, account, signed, or release proof.

## Current route defaults

- Choose native DAT for an iOS companion app that needs supported device access through the official iOS SDK.
- Choose DAT Android for an Android companion app; do not translate Swift symbols or Info.plist keys by analogy.
- Run the full-SDK auditor before calling a dependency graph or feature list “full.”
- Choose a native DAT Display path only after the target device reports Display capability.
- Choose a Web App for a Ray-Ban Display surface that is intentionally delivered as a public HTML/CSS/JS experience.
- Keep the phone surface as the fallback and consent/control plane when the wearable route is unavailable or not yet proven.
- Treat Meta AI voice commands and a public “Gen 3” API mapping as unresolved unless a current official source and hardware evidence establish them.
- Treat “on-device” as a claim requiring an explicit processing location and evidence; a phone companion is not automatically glasses-native.
